My solutions for Advent of Code 2020.

-----

I'd done a couple puzzles from a previous AOC (2017, I think), but had never participated as it was ongoing. It was much more fun than I expected!

This was partly used as an opportunity to try out coding in an IDE, instead of Jupyter (I'd previously seen Joel Grus's "I Don't Like Notebooks" [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jiPeIFXb6U) and was curious to see how it would differ).
